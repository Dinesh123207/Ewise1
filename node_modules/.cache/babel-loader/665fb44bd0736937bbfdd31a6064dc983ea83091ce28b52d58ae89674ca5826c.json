As consumers, manufacturers, and advocates, our choices today shape the environmental legacy of electronic devices tomorrow.</p>\r\n\r\n        </div>\r\n        </div>\r\n        <div>\r\n            <Footer/>\r\n        </div>\r\n    </>\r\n  )\r\n}\r\n"],"mappings":";AAAA,OAAOA,KAAK,MAAM,OAAO;AACzB,OAAOC,MAAM,MAAM,sBAAsB;AACzC,OAAOC,MAAM,MAAM,sBAAsB;AACzC,OAAOC,MAAM,MAAM,qBAAqB;AAAA,SAAAC,MAAA,IAAAC,OAAA;AAAA,SAAAC,QAAA,IAAAC,SAAA;AACxC,eAAe,SAASC,KAAKA,CAAA,EAAG;EAC9B,oBACEH,OAAA,CAAAE,SAAA;IAAAE,QAAA,gBACIJ,OAAA;MAAAI,QAAA,eACAJ,OAAA,CAACJ,MAAM;QAAAS,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;QAAAC,UAAA;QAAAC,YAAA;MAAA,OAAC;IAAC;MAAAH,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;MAAAC,UAAA;MAAAC,YAAA;IAAA,OACR,CAAC,eACNR,OAAA;MAAAI,QAAA,gBACAJ,OAAA;QAAAK,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;QAAAC,UAAA;QAAAC,YAAA;MAAA,OAAI,CAAC,eACHR,OAAA;QAAAI,QAAA,eACEJ,OAAA;UAAKS,GAAG,EAAIX,MAAO;UAAEY,KAAK,EAAI;YAACC,KAAK,EAAE;UAAO;QAAE;UAAAN,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;UAAAC,UAAA;UAAAC,YAAA;QAAA,OAAC;MAAC;QAAAH,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;QAAAC,UAAA;QAAAC,YAAA;MAAA,OAC9C,CAAC,eACJR,OAAA;QAAKU,KAAK,EAAI;UAACE,SAAS,EAAE,MAAM;UAAEC,MAAM,EAAE,OAAO;UAAEC,SAAS,EAAE,MAAM;UAAEC,KAAK,EAAE;QAAO,CAAE;QAAAX,QAAA,gBAClFJ,OAAA;UAAAI,QAAA,eAAIJ,OAAA;YAAQU,KAAK,EAAI;cAACK,KAAK,EAAE;YAAO,CAAE;YAAAX,QAAA,EAAC;UAA+G;YAAAC,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;YAAAC,UAAA;YAAAC,YAAA;UAAA,OAAQ;QAAC;UAAAH,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;UAAAC,UAAA;UAAAC,YAAA;QAAA,OAAI,CAAC,eACpKR,OAAA;UAAAI,QAAA,EAAG;QAAic;UAAAC,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;UAAAC,UAAA;UAAAC,YAAA;QAAA,OAAG,CAAC,eACxcR,OAAA;UAAAI,QAAA,eAAIJ,OAAA;YAAAI,QAAA,EAAQ;UAAmC;YAAAC,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;YAAAC,UAAA;YAAAC,YAAA;UAAA,OAAQ;QAAC;UAAAH,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;UAAAC,UAAA;UAAAC,YAAA;QAAA,OAAI,CAAC,eAC7DR,OAAA;UAAAI,QAAA,EAAG;QAA8X;UAAAC,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;UAAAC,UAAA;UAAAC,YAAA;QAAA,OAAG,CAAC,eACrYR,OAAA;UAAAI,QAAA,eAAIJ,OAAA;YAAAI,QAAA,EAAQ;UAAsC;YAAAC,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;YAAAC,UAAA;YAAAC,YAAA;UAAA,OAAQ;QAAC;UAAAH,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;UAAAC,UAAA;UAAAC,YAAA;QAAA,OAAI,CAAC,eAChER,OAAA;UAAAI,QAAA,EAAG;QAA6V;UAAAC,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;UAAAC,UAAA;UAAAC,YAAA;QAAA,OAAG,CAAC,eACpWR,OAAA;UAAAI,QAAA,eAAIJ,OAAA;YAAAI,QAAA,EAAQ;UAA+C;YAAAC,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;YAAAC,UAAA;YAAAC,YAAA;UAAA,OAAQ;QAAC;UAAAH,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;UAAAC,UAAA;UAAAC,YAAA;QAAA,OAAI,CAAC,eACzER,OAAA;UAAAI,QAAA,EAAG;QAA6T;UAAAC,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;UAAAC,UAAA;UAAAC,YAAA;QAAA,OAAG,CAAC,eACpUR,OAAA;UAAAI,QAAA,eAAIJ,OAAA;YAAAI,QAAA,EAAQ;UAA6B;YAAAC,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;YAAAC,UAAA;YAAAC,YAAA;UAAA,OAAQ;QAAC;UAAAH,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;UAAAC,UAAA;UAAAC,YAAA;QAAA,OAAI,CAAC,eACvDR,OAAA;UAAAI,QAAA,EAAG;QAA6V;UAAAC,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;UAAAC,UAAA;UAAAC,YAAA;QAAA,OAAG,CAAC,eACpWR,OAAA;UAAAI,QAAA,eAAIJ,OAAA;YAAAI,QAAA,EAAQ;UAA+C;YAAAC,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;YAAAC,UAAA;YAAAC,YAAA;UAAA,OAAQ;QAAC;UAAAH,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;UAAAC,UAAA;UAAAC,YAAA;QAAA,OAAI,CAAC,eACzER,OAAA;UAAAI,QAAA,EAAG;QAA4W;UAAAC,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;UAAAC,UAAA;UAAAC,YAAA;QAAA,OAAG,CAAC,eACnXR,OAAA;UAAAI,QAAA,eAAIJ,OAAA;YAAAI,QAAA,EAAQ;UAA0B;YAAAC,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;YAAAC,UAAA;YAAAC,YAAA;UAAA,OAAQ;QAAC;UAAAH,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;UAAAC,UAAA;UAAAC,YAAA;QAAA,OAAI,CAAC,eACpDR,OAAA;UAAAI,QAAA,EAAG;QAA6X;UAAAC,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;UAAAC,UAAA;UAAAC,YAAA;QAAA,OAAG,CAAC,eACpYR,OAAA;UAAAI,QAAA,eAAIJ,OAAA;YAAAI,QAAA,EAAQ;UAAuC;YAAAC,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;YAAAC,UAAA;YAAAC,YAAA;UAAA,OAAQ;QAAC;UAAAH,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;UAAAC,UAAA;UAAAC,YAAA;QAAA,OAAI,CAAC,eACjER,OAAA;UAAAI,QAAA,EAAG;QAAyS;UAAAC,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;UAAAC,UAAA;UAAAC,YAAA;QAAA,OAAG,CAAC,eAChTR,OAAA;UAAAI,QAAA,eAAIJ,OAAA;YAAAI,QAAA,EAAQ;UAAY;YAAAC,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;YAAAC,UAAA;YAAAC,YAAA;UAAA,OAAQ;QAAC;UAAAH,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;UAAAC,UAAA;UAAAC,YAAA;QAAA,OAAI,CAAC,eACtCR,OAAA;UAAAI,QAAA,EAAG;QAAsnB;UAAAC,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;UAAAC,UAAA;UAAAC,YAAA;QAAA,OAAG,CAAC;MAAA;QAAAH,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;QAAAC,UAAA;QAAAC,YAAA;MAAA,OAE5nB,CAAC;IAAA;MAAAH,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;MAAAC,UAAA;MAAAC,YAAA;IAAA,OACD,CAAC,eACNR,OAAA;MAAAI,QAAA,eACIJ,OAAA,CAACH,MAAM;QAAAQ,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;QAAAC,UAAA;QAAAC,YAAA;MAAA,OAAC;IAAC;MAAAH,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;MAAAC,UAAA;MAAAC,YAAA;IAAA,OACR,CAAC;EAAA,eACR,CAAC;AAEP"},"metadata":{},"sourceType":"module","externalDependencies":[]}
